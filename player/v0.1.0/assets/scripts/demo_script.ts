/* 
  This is a Punchy script!

  This one is added to the game globally in the default.game.yaml's scripts section. This doesn't do
  anything useful but is used to show how to get started.

  First off, if you open this script in the Punchy repo, you will get typescript auto-completion
  because of the types files and the `tsconfig.json` file in the repo. If you have your own game
  folder, you can copy the `tsconfig.json` and related files to get that working in your project.

/* 
  Until this is automated, in order to access Bevy components in our script, we create these type
  definitions in order to inform TypeScript how to load our component.

  The bevy core types come out-of-the-box, so you only need to add your game's components like this.
